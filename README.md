# DI-ProcessGuide

##Scope:
Digital Inclusion partners that are performing imaging of donated hardware need a robust process to receive, track, manage and deploy refurbished assets.

##Goal Statement
The needs of LMHA for imaging need to be scaled to a larger operational level. To support this, I have built a server utilizing the [FOG Project](https://fogproject.org) to capture and deploy system images.

The image we have chosen for reliability, simplicity, security and licensing is Neverware's ChromeOS build, [CloudReady](https://www.neverware.com/freedownload). This has been deployed on 54 existing laptops & desktops utilizing a manual process.

Processing application has been built in AirTable.
##Intended Results
* Standardize the refurbishment process
* Greatly increase output quality & amount
* Create a process that can be easily replicated (taught to VISTAs, or any other contributor)
* Provide metrics & asset tracking that are generated by the process, as opposed to manual collection

##Metrics

Possible Metrics:
Goal: Percent saturation of computing devices by demographic statistic (low income, SNAP etc?)
